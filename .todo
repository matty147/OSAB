// editor
highlight the object selected somehow
fix objects cliping
you can write invalid characters into it like japanese chinese or ⌡╥...
can click on object even when multiple are overlayed on top of each other
fix setting invalid characters into the text field allow _ atleast
normalize scale and xy positions
hide the value/ make it unchangable so its eaisier for me :D
obj_editor_enemy - why do we need a name and a sprite it should be the same thing?
if entered level editor with keys and the mouse is not on screen there is no way to controll anything - may be with more things
finish the fucking save shit you already have the fucking data why not use it????????
when dragging left and scrolling at the same time the object jumps to the previous position without updating its own
when editor_enemy is mostly offsreen it changes the time for some reason^
objercts can overlap - pls fix this or i very sad and das not gud D:\]
wtf is wrong with me for doing ln 37 in obj_object_settings draw_gui event. the user cant edit that shit D:. we have to add array editing fml
why is ther a object_name and a sprite value????????????????


// optimisation
level select freeplay - loading tanks the fps by a lot

// overall?
could make a basic save system
zip levels from editor to easily upload
add song author to metadata
add music to level editoru

//extra things for the level editor that must be finished!!!!
adding the music and the png to the level
