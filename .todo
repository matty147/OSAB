// editor
highlight the object selected somehow
fix objects cliping
you can write invalid characters into it like japanese chinese or ⌡╥...
can click on object even when multiple are overlayed on top of each other
fix setting invalid characters into the text field allow _ atleast
normalize scale and xy positions
hide the value/ make it unchangable so its eaisier for me :D
obj_editor_enemy - why do we need a name and a sprite it should be the same thing?
if entered level editor with keys and the mouse is not on screen there is no way to controll anything - may be with more things

// optimisation
level select freeplay - loading tanks the fps by a lot
